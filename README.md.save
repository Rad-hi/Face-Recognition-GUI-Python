## Description

This is a desktop app created with python and its built in library "Tkinter".

This app uses the "face_recognition" and "OpenCV" libraries for basic computer vision and facial recognition.

### Key Words

- Python: Face_recognition, OpenCV, Tkinter, OS, PIL.

- Computer Vision: facial recognition.

## Disclamer

This article assumes having basic knowledge of Python, Tkinter, OpenCV, face_recognition, since these will not be covered here.

## How to use

### Dependecies:

You'll have to have these libraries along with Python in your PC:

- Numpy

- Tkinter (if you're running Linux, you'll have to install it, otherwise, it comes with Python when installed)

- The 3 files provided in this repo located in the same folder.

- pyscreenshot (Only if you're running Linux, otherwise, you can use ImageGrab from the PIL lib)

### Manipulation

- Run the main.py file

- This interface will open:

- You can load any .obj file you want, or you can choose from the files 
provided in the /Objects folder.

- After loading the 3D model, you can move it UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT using the U/D/L/R buttons or using the arrow keys on your keyboard.

- You can zoom in and out, or rotate the model in 3 axis.

- You can take screenshots too with the "Take screenshot" button.
